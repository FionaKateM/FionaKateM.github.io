        <h1>Feeling lost with AI?<br> Let's find where it fits your business.</h1>
        <p class="subtitle">AI strategy & implementation for small & medium businesses â€“ without the tech jargon.</p>
        <p>You know your business inside out, but navigating the world of Artificial Intelligence feels overwhelming. You hear the buzz, but you're not sure how, or even <em>if</em>, AI can genuinely help <strong>your</strong> company without losing the unique spark that makes you successful.</p>
    </header>

    <section class="section">
        <h2>Worried AI isn't right for you?</h2>
        <p>Does any of this sound familiar?</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Fear of losing your touch:</strong> "Will AI dilute or erase what makes my business special?"</li>
            <li><strong>Trust issues:</strong> "How can I trust an 'expert' not to oversell AI just to get my business, especially when I don't understand the tech?"</li>
            <li><strong>Feeling behind:</strong> "Is it too late? Has everyone else already figured AI out?"</li>
            <li><strong>Complexity concerns:</strong> "I don't really get AI â€“ how can I make informed decisions?"</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Choosing the wrong path with AI, or the wrong guide, can waste time and money. But ignoring it might mean missing valuable opportunities to <strong>enhance</strong> what you already do brilliantly.</p>

        <h2>My Approach: Putting your business first</h2>
        <p>You need someone who listens first and understands <em>your</em> specific goals and challenges. That's where I come in.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>I start by understanding:</strong> We'll talk about your business, your pain points, and what success looks like <em>for you</em>.</li>
            <li><strong>Focus on <em>enhancing</em>, not replacing:</strong> My goal is to find where AI can boost your existing strengths and processes.</li>
            <li><strong>Clear, jargon-free communication:</strong> I explain the opportunities and the technology in plain English, so you feel confident and informed.</li>
            <li><strong>No hard sell, no BS:</strong> If AI isn't the right fit for a particular problem, I'll tell you. My priority is finding solutions that genuinely benefit <strong>your</strong> business. And if I'm not the right person to help, I'll suggest someone who is.</li>
            <li><strong>Flexible, milestone-based plans:</strong> AI often involves experimentation. We'll work in stages, and you'll have the option to pause or stop at any milestone â€“ no pressure.</li>
            <li><strong>Results-driven:</strong> I define success based on <em>your</em> business metrics and what's important to you.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Experience you can trust</h2>
        <p>I've designed and implemented effective AI solutions at multiple businesses, ranging from major corporations (like the <strong>BBC</strong> and <strong>NatWest Group</strong>) to innovative startups (like <strong>Voice Arcade</strong>, <strong>labworks.io</strong>, and <strong>Worktripp</strong>). I bring practical experience working directly with experts from leading AI companies (like <strong>Google</strong>, <strong>OpenAI</strong>, <strong>IBM</strong>, and <strong>Amazon</strong>) and translate that into real-world applications for businesses like yours.</p>
